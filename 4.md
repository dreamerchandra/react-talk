# Performance Issue #2: The 10-Second Page Render Mystery

## üîç The Problem
- Project Plan taking 10 seconds to render
- Users experiencing significant delays
- Initial investigation showed no obvious network issues

## üïµÔ∏è Root Cause Analysis

### The Culprits
1. **Ant Design (AntD) Component Library**
   - Monkey patching css calculations
   - Synchronous DOM measurements (Forced reflow)

2. **Animations** 
   - Box shadows causing layout thrashing
   - Progress bar animations triggering forced reflows
   - Partial page updates causing style recalculations



*Remember: Performance optimization is an iterative process. Always measure before and after changes!*
