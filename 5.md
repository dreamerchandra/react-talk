# ➡️ Moving forward 

- Quick recap
> We can use performance to measure performance of a particular iteration or overall page.
> React profiler to measure component level performance.

- What if we want to improve a particular page performance if it has 1000s of components?

# Performance Tab
- JS stack traces
- Animations
- React components
- Network requests
- Paint events
- Memory allocations
- Screenshots
- CPU usage
- Frame rate
- FCP, LCP
- User timings
- CSS selector stats
- Paint stats

### Performance Hints

- Advanced paint instrumentation → shows you how painting happens & how long it takes.
- CSS selector stats → shows you how expensive CSS rules are to match.
- Long tasks → shows you tasks that block the main thread for 50ms or more.







# Layer Tab
- Shows you how layers are created and composited in the browser.
- Stacking context
- Layer composition
- Debug Layers

# WTF is RAIL!

- RAIL is a user-centric performance model that breaks down the user experience into distinct actions: Response, Animation, Idle, and Load.

#### Response
- The goal is to respond to user input within 100ms to ensure the app feels responsive
- Examples: Click, Scroll, Key press

#### Animation
- The goal is to keep animations smooth by rendering frames within 16ms (for 60fps)
- Examples: Scrolling, Dragging, Transitions

#### Idle
- The goal is to perform background tasks during idle periods without blocking the main thread for more than 50ms
- Examples: Preloading data, Lazy loading images

#### Load
- The goal is to load the initial content within 1 second on a fast 3G connection
- Examples: Initial page load, Navigating to a new page
